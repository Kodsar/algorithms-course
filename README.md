# Princeton Algorithms Course - Exercise Repository

This repository contains my solutions to the programming assignments from the **Algorithms, Part I** course on Coursera, provided by Princeton University. Each folder corresponds to a major topic covered in the course.

## Structure

The repository is organized by topics:

- `union_find/` - Union-Find data structure and its applications.
- `performance_analysis/` - Analyzing algorithm performance and memory usage.
- `stacks_queues/` - Implementation and applications of stacks and queues.
- `elementary_sorting/` - Elementary sorting algorithms such as Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Shell Sort.
- `mergesort/` - Merge Sort and its non-recursive version.
- `quicksort/` - QuickSort and QuickSelect algorithms.
- `priority_queues/` - Implementation of priority queues and Heapsort.
- `symbol_tables/` - Symbol tables (associative arrays, dictionaries) and binary search trees.
- `balanced_search_trees/` - 2-3 trees, red-black trees, and B-trees.
- `range_searching/` - Kd-trees and range searching.
- `hashing/` - Hash functions, hash tables, and their applications.
- `applications/` - Applications of symbol tables.

## How to Use
